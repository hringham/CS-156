			<h3>Inspiration</h3>
			<div>
				<p>For me, fantasy is a big aspect of who I am. I love to believe that 
				magic and fairy tales exist, and I also know that some people are true 
				believers of the opposite. I wanted to challenge that belief and create a 
				project that would showcase a situation in which they could live and 
				prosper together. <cite>Josephine Wall</cite>, an artist from the United Kingdom, 
				makes a lot of surreal paintings that all inspired this project. This 
				painting perfectly embodies the notion that everything may seem as 
				“reality”, but is really fantastical.</p>

			<h3>Composition</h3>
			<div>
				<p>I made the sides of the house curved so that I could explore how the 
				different stages of clay responded to being constructed with slabs. The 
				book as the lid is used to further demonstrate both fantasy and reality, 
				as they can be of both genres. The house being curved in makes it appear 
				old and aged, as what would happen to a real house because of time and 
				what a house in a fantasy world might look like because of architectural 
				style.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Principles and Elements of Design</h3>
			<div>
				<h4>Principles of Design</h4>
				<p>Proportion and scale was achieved well most notably in the scale 
				between the size of the house and the size of the book. In some fairy 
				tales the house is much smaller than one would think, such as the story 
				where a shoe is used as a house. There was contrast between the perfect 
				string lights on one side and the ones that were falling off on the 
				other. One principle that I would have liked to push further was rhythm 
				and movement.</p>
				<h4>Elements of Design</h4>
				<p>Line was achieved through my use of a small piping tool that allowed 
				me to draw slip onto the piece. I wanted to place a lot of lines on my 
				piece as I felt that it would contribute to the look of it being a 
				gingerbread house. Space was also achieved well through my use of cutting 
				out windows into the clay. I wanted to invite the viewer to view both the 
				inside and outside, and this allowed me to do that. One element that I 
				could have pushed further was texture.</p>
			</div>

		<section id="glaze">
			<h3>Glaze</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Christmas is known to be red and green because red represents the 
				blood that Jesus shed during his crucifixion, and green represents the 
				evergreen trees during the winter season. I wanted to use clear glaze on 
				the outside because it would show my mistakes. I then decided to use 
				black sparkles on the inside because it is seen as the opposite. Also, 
				darkness is something that is often overlooked in the fantasy world.</p>
			</div>
		</section><hr />
		<section id="craft">
			<h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
			<div>
				<p>For this project, I had to have a good understanding of the stages of 
				clay and also of slipping and scoring. I feel that I did both of those 
				fairly well. I learned that it is easier to make attachments, allow them 
				to dry slightly, and smooth them out before attaching rather then smooth 
				them out after attaching. One thing I would have done differently is I 
				would have liked to add my side walls sooner.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The aesthetics of this project reflected my love for Christmas and 
				gingerbread houses. In addition to functioning as a box, I had also 
				intended for this project to be able to function as a candle holder, 
				similarly to a jack-o-lantern. The money bricks, clock, and social media 
				are all representations of aspects of reality that I struggle with. All 
				of my ceramics projects, but this one especially, taught me to be patient 
				with the process. If I tried to put it together before it was ready or 
				rushed myself to get it together, it would work, but not as well as I 
				wanted it to.</p>
