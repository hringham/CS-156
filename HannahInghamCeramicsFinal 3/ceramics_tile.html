				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<div>
					<p>My carnivorous plant tile triptych was inspired by the idea of 
						confusion, repulsion, and also beauty in art. From some student 
						examples and also from artist <cite>Adriana Varejão</cite>, I was
						drawn to how their pieces were influenced by both the beauty and 
						ugliness in nature. I decided to go with a plant to convey these 
						emotions also because of my own influences, including my venus fly 
						trap plant at home and also my love of the show Stranger Things.</p>

				<h3>Composition</h3>
				<div>
					<p> I decided to make each tile rectangular to keep the focus on the 
						subject of the tiles, not on the background. I especially wanted to 
						place emphasis on the top tile because it houses the ‘face’ of the 
						plant. The bottom tile is the next important, as it holds the grounds 
						of the plant and where it began. Thus, the middle tile is the smallest 
						because it is the transitional state. One way I could improve upon the 
						composition of my next project is to plan out the middle transitional 
						tile before making it next time.</p>
				</div>

			<section id="texture">
				<h3>Texture</h3>
				<div>
					<p>I used relief to emphasize specific parts of the composition, such as 
						the teeth of the plant and also its leaf hands appearing to reach for 
						the viewer. Using textures greatly enhanced my composition because 
						they added and extra element of harshness to my tiles that a smooth 
						surface would not have achieved. However, I do wish that I had 
						explored with some other tools more. This project was one where my 
						goal was to be jarring, so being more adventurous with textures would 
						only have pushed that further.</p>
				</div>

			<section id="color">
				<h3>Color</h3>
				<div>
					<p>I chose mostly green tones to go in my triptych tile to stick with the 
						idea that my subject is a plant. However, the soil and the mouth are 
						vastly different than the greens. All of these colors worked 
						successfully in my design, and I love how the glaze enhanced the 
						teeth of the beast. The green shades on each tile bring them together, 
						and the darker shades provide some contrast. The darker shades are 
						also placed on the bottom and top tiles to provide unity between all 
						three pieces because they hold the entire form together in between 
						the two colors.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Principles of Design</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Rhythm and movement was achieved through the story I told in my 
						tiles-from a sprout, to a teenaged plant, then an adult carnivore. 
						Secondly, I achieved emphasis through my use of texture, relief, and 
						color. There is much emphasis placed on the head of the carnivorous 
						plant. Also, I achieved pattern in both the backgrounds of each tile 
						as well as the 5-point star face that the plant has. Lastly, unity is 
						achieved through the use of color and texture. The same colors are 
						used in each tile, which unifies them in a way. Additionally, the 
						textured background unifies each of the tiles.</p>
				</div>

			<section id="craft">
				<h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Although I was at first worried about my piece not being as smooth as 
						I wanted, I found a new technique for smoothing smaller areas with the 
						help of Professor Fischer. And while I have worked with clay before, 
						it seems that clay is a widely variable medium. I learned much about 
						the stages of clay and how each has an important role regarding 
						craftsmanship.Additionally, I learned a lot about the craftsmanship of 
						glaze. My project, being very high relief, was hard to glaze at times 
						and some parts may not have been as full coverage as I wanted.</p>
