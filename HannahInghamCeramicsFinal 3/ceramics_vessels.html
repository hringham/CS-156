				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<div>
					<p>My three coil vessels were originally influenced by a personal 
						experience that I had over the summer, where my mother and I planted 
						a seed packet that attracted a trio of pollinators: the bee &#128029; 
						, the butterfly &#129419; , and the hummingbird &#128038; . My three 
						vessels were influenced by <cite>Beth Sherman</cite>. Sherman 
						prioritizes art that can be both functional and evocative. She 
						<em>also</em> shares that her style portrays her 
						<q>sadness for its precarious state</q>.<br /></p>

				<h3>Composition</h3>
				<div>
					<p>I was thoughtful to pick the silhouettes according to the pollinator 
						they were influenced by: the bee is short and round, the butterfly 
						stands tall and thin, and the hummingbird reaches with its beak. 
						While each vessel has a different silhouette, they are unified 
						through the flower embellishments on each lip. Furthermore, each 
						vessel has a rounded foot, belly, and neck, although each one is 
						slightly more or less subtle according to its subject.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Principles and Elements of Design</h3>
				<div>
					<h4>Principles of Design</h4>
					<p>Pattern was achieved most notably on the hummingbird piece through 
						its feathers. Rhythm and movement can be seen in all three pieces. 
						In the butterfly, movement can be seen through its wings as well 
						as they float off the vessel. One principle that I would have 
						liked to push further is harmony. I feel as though these animals 
						are only connected through their ability to pollinate, and not 
						much in their anatomy.</p>
					<h4>Elements of Design</h4>
					<p>Two elements of design that were successful in my series were form and 
						texture. The silhouettes contributed greatly to the design of these 
						vessels, and they were very successful.	Additionally, each vessel had 
						a texture that was characteristic of their subject, and that helped to 
						unify them while individualizing as well. One element that I would 
						like to explore further in my next project is space.</p>

				<h3>Glaze</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The most important colors in my series are blue, black, and yellow. 
						Blue is a color that has multiple meanings, some of which being 
						sadness and royalty. Black is representative of evil but can also be 
						interpreted as power and strength. This also carries a bit of a 
						reversed definition as the majority of the black color is in the bee, 
						which most people see as small and powerless. Lastly, yellow is a 
						color that evokes feelings of happiness and optimism, which is how I 
						was feeling throughout most of this project.</p>
				</div>

			<section id="craft">
				<h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Focusing on good craftsmanship during the coiling process set me up for 
					success with attachments because of how smooth the surface was. However, I 
					feel as though my craftsmanship could definitely improve in terms of 
					scoring and slipping, especially on the flowers on the lip of each vessel. 
					Additionally, I learned a lot about the stages of clay and how it is 
					different to attach wet clay to wet clay and drier clay to wet clay. I am 
					going to use this new knowledge, especially on my final project, to ensure 
					that all attachments are well made.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Overall, my project is both decorative and functional. I hope that it 
						will be used in my family’s home the way it was intended—that is, both 
						appreciated as art and used to encourage pollination through the 
						plants inside of them. I like to focus on art as beauty, but it is 
						often more than that. In addition, I have learned that it is okay to 
						ask for help when I am feeling like I can’t do anything on my own.</p>
